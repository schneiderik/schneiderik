  <p>
    Ashley and I went to Paris at the end of November. I made this book to remember the trip. This is actually my first zine that is not primarily comics.

    Ashley and I have thought about ditching our families on Thanksgiving and going overseas for a long time. This year we finally had the guts (and the cash) to make it happen. We picked Paris, but not because France is the largest producer and exporter of turkey meat in the world, but because Ashley thinks French culture is somehow better.  Just like me, she had never been to Paris, however, she had taken 4 years of French in college. Even though I had never heard her use it, I could only assume that this meant she was fluent and would be doing all of the talking. I knew all of the stereotypes about how Parisians felt about Americans, especially those that made no effort speak the language, so I feverously studied French during the months leading up to our trip.  It was my first time out of North America, and I thought, “Maybe I can make it not seem that way.”

    We arrived at Chuck De Gaulle Airport around 10am Paris-time.  A lot of people we talked to about our trip told us Paris was beautiful, but would go on to say, “Well… I’ve never been to Paris, but I had a layover at that fancy-pants airport they got there!” Maybe it’s because I haven’t been to many airports, but its charm was lost on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    We emerged from the metro to find Paris unexpectedly quiet and sleepy.  It was too early for us to check into our apartment, so we found a restaurant nearby to kill some time.  A friendly waitress, greeted us with a calm, “Bonjour,” and then a whole bunch of stuff I wasn’t prepared for.  I nervously looked at Ashley hoping to hear a confident reply shoot from her mouth.  She was as lost for words as I was. We all looked at one another for a moment until the waitress said softly, “Are you here for breakfast
    or lunch?”

    Without the internet to guide us, we plotted out our course for the day on a map our AirBnb host gave us.  We headed to Notre Dame, and then walked along the river until we came to the Eiffel Tower.  The line for the lift curled back and forth adding up to a 90 minute wait.  Luckily, there was also an option to take the stairs for a reduced cost, an idea at which Ashley remarked, “What the ****? Why would I pay to climb stairs?!” After talking it over we decided to buy tickets for the stairs, something I knew I could handle. “Deux billets s’il vous plaît,” I silently repeated to myself as I approached the counter. After exchanging hello’s with the attendant the words hastily sputtered out of my mouth. It wasn’t pretty, but it worked.  I climbed those steps knowing I had cracked the code. I had earned my way into their secret club, making the view from the summit both rich with accomplishment as well as breathtaking.

    We started the next day by stopping in a little bagel sandwich shop down the street.  Still high from my induction into the French speaking elite, I strolled in confident that everyone inside was keen to my complete legitimacy as a globetrotter.  We ordered our sandwiches with ease and moved down to the end of the counter. The owner met us with a smile, and asked if we would like something to drink.  In French, I responded, “I would like a bottle of water, please.”  She turned to open the cooler door, but before she reached in she turned and asked, “Plate ou gazeuse?”  What?! Don’t throw me a curve-ball like that! I was on such a roll.  I could do nothing but blankly stare.   She quickly realized we weren’t from around there, and clarified, “Plain or sparkling?”  We sat down to eat our sandwiches and talk about our plans for the day.  Ashley paused and leaned in to whisper, “The girls next to us think were German.”  Ashley’s 100% German and looks it, so it was easy to see why. The owner may have known we were American, but we sure had them fooled.

    Before we left for the trip, someone asked me if we were going to the Louvre, and if I was excited to see all of the classic paintings there.  I responded, “I’m excited, but I don’t think we will be there for very long. I’m hoping we can go to more modern museums.”  Looking back, my answer was far from accurate.
  </p>
  <p>
    We ended up walking around for over six and a half hours.  I had never seen paintings so massive, and in such a quantity that you really have a chance to witness art movements change as you passed from room to room.  Ashley’s undergrad degree is in Art History. She really helped me to appreciate what exactly I was seeing.  As we walked through each display, I began to see how important it was to here to see some of these paintings, most of which she had only seen as thumbnails in textbooks. She was so moved when she saw the Mona Lisa it brought her to tears.  That is, until the girl next to her took a peace sign selfie in front of it.

    I had been getting bad sleep since we landed, but the previous night I couldn’t dose off until close to 5am. When I finally woke up, Ashley and I hopped on the train to go tour the catacombs.  We stepped down beneath the sewers and the subway into a world so drastically different from Paris above.  Walls of bones were intricately arranged on either side of us, which we learned through the audio tour, was actually someone’s job around the turn of the century.  The audio tour was really what made it so interesting. Between Ashley teaching me as we walk through museums, and this audio tour, I’ve really learned to appreciate the story of why a painting or exhibit is the way it is so much more than the piece itself.

    As it was Thanksgiving, we headed home to get ready for dinner. It slipped our minds that we may have needed to make reservations to have a fancy dinner, but by a stroke of luck, got a table tucked in a corner at a nearby restaurant serving an “American Thanksgiving.” One of the best Thanksgiving dinners I’ve had to date.

    Ashley’s education background is in Art History, specifically art around the turn of the century.  Museé D’Orsay was a highlight for her.  The opportunity to see wall-sized paintings that she had previously only seen thumbnails of in books was an overwhelming experience for her.  She had to capture it, even if it meant breaking the rules. Like all criminals, she was eventually caught, but not before she snapped pictures of priceless works of art.
  </p>
  <p>
    After Museé D’Orsay, we headed over to Musée des Arts Décoratifs where there was an exhibit on Trompe-l’œil. One room displayed a collection of gold vases and furniture in glass cases that, in reality, were only protecting manufactured plastic props.  When I’m walking through most museums and galleries, I often think about how fake I must look.  A poseur pretending to appreciate art.  I’m a jackass in a black turtleneck and a beret with his arm folded over his chest, staring at an orange dot on the wall.

    As the day came to a close, Ashley and I found ourselves walking around our neighborhood in the rain looking for something to eat.  We looped in and out of streets, passing restaurant after restaurant, but neither of us could decide what we wanted.  I’m usually quick  to make the decision, but it was different this time. I felt completely out of my element.  I had been in Paris for 6 days.  I was tired of practicing French phrases in my head, tired from sleeping so poorly, and tired from consuming so much culture in such a sort amount of time.  Ashley wasn’t sure how I would react to international travel, and to be honest, neither was I.  I was so nervous about disappointing the people I would interact with that I placed an unfair amount of pressure on Ashley to make the trip comfortable and familiar.  I told myself she was an expert on everything French, when in reality we were both blindly feeling our way through the experience. I realized this now, but I still couldn’t bare to process anything else for the night, so Ashley and I headed home to rest up and make our last day in Paris special.

    Honestly, this was my favorite day of our trip.  We had seen all that we wanted, so we decided to just head out to eat street food, shop for family members, and explore parts of Paris we hadn’t visited yet.  We stopped at a comic book shop where I bought a collection of French comics. I’ll learn how to read them someday.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was really hungry after we left the comic shop, so we popped in to a place that was selling donor kebab, something a friend from Germany told us we should try while we were there.  I had done enough practicing that I felt comfortable enough to order everything in French. Ashley even asked how much a bottle of plain water was.  The exchange was completely ordinary and mundane, but it had adrenaline pumping through my veins.  To top it off, as he handed me the cone of pork meat and fries, he exclaimed, “Great job!”  I walked away smiling, feeling like I had accomplished the impossible. Ashley and I headed home to get some rest for our flight home leaving early the next morning.

  <p>
    There were about a thousand places something could have happened that would have caused us to miss our flight.  We had to take a train to a bus, catch a flight to Madrid, and finally board our flight home to Chicago.  I was so worried about something going wrong that I didn’t sleep.  When 4:30 a.m. rolled around, I was ready to go.  We caught the first train in the morning, got to the bus stop just before it pulled out, and arrived at Orly an hour and a half before our flight to Madrid.
  </p>
  <p>
    After over 40 hours of no sleep, I was finally headed home.  Ashley wasn’t sure how much I would enjoy international travel, and neither was I, but when people ask how it was, I usually reply, “It was fun, but that doesn’t begin to describe all of the emotions I felt.”  I found it exhausting, but not in a bad way. It was like a hard workout. One that leaves you drained but proud of yourself.  I need some time to rest afterward, and prepare myself for our next trip.
