  <h1 class="title">Thirty Days of Comics 2013</h1>
  <p>
    It had been a long time since I made comics. So I wanted to ease myself back into the routine. Coincidentally,
    November was just around the corner, and I saw on twitter that a bunch of people do <em>Thirty Days of Comics</em> over the course of the month.
    It was the perfect opportunity.
    Looking back on the attempt, I should have made the comics less time consuming.
    Also, I should have looked ahead, because when I started the month I wasn't thinking about the fact that I would be leaving for Paris on the 23rd.
  </p>
  <p>
    I successfully kept up with it for 22 days, but didn't commit to drawing overseas.
    The comics from Paris were drawn over the following month.
    I spent much more time on them as it was my first time out of North America and a very special experience.
