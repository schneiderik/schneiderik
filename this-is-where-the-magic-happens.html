  <p>
    The idea for this poster came from a conversation with a coworker about MTV Cribs. As the host would lead the camera crew into thier bedroom, they would always say the same clich√© comment. I put together the print for a friend's birthday, but decided to sell it at the Chicago Alternative Comics Expo as well.
